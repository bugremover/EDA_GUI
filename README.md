A user-friendly, open-source web application to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, **data visualization**, and even **basic machine learning (Linear Regression)** — all without writing a single line of code.

> ⚠️ Still a **work in progress** — open for contributions and feedback!

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Upload CSV or Excel files
* ✅ Clean and preprocess data (drop NAs, duplicates, encode categoricals)
* ✅ Perform visual EDA:

  * Scatter plots
  * Histograms
  * Box plots
  * Heatmaps
  * Pairplots
* ✅ Train a **Linear Regression** model
* ✅ Predict using user input (single or multiple features)
* ✅ Built entirely with:

  * `Python`, `Streamlit`
  * `Pandas`, `Numpy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`

## 🧠 Ideas You Can Work On

* Add support for classification (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)
* Compare multiple models and show scores
* Export trained model as `.pkl`
* Dark mode UI 🎨
* Add Streamlit forms for cleaner UI/UX
* Use `PyCaret` or `AutoSklearn` for automated ML
* Add a side panel with tips/tutorials
